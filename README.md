# Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover Strategy
This repository contains the implementation of a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover Strategy applied to the CAC40 Index using Python. The strategy uses short-term and long-term moving averages to identify trading signals, helping traders make data-driven decisions.

## Overview
The SMA Crossover Strategy involves two key moving averages:

### 50-day SMA (short-term): Captures short-term price movements.
### 200-day SMA (long-term): Identifies the overall market trend.
## Trading Signals:
### Buy Signal: When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, indicating a potential upward trend.
### Sell Signal: When the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA, signaling a possible downward trend.
